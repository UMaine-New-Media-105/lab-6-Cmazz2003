Exercise 1 - We had to write a sketch in which two sprites are drawn using functions. Unfortunately, I was not able to make so the luffy sprite will move with arrow keys. The intention was to make it so Luffy can move and eat the meat sprite

Exercise 2 - I was supposed to make it so the meat disappears after Luffy eats it however, I didn't get that far.

Exercise 3 - I was supposed to spawn the meat 5 times until Luffy eats them all however, I didn't get that far.
